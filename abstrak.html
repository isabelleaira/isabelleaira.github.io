    <u>This bazaar was held for the purpose of fulfilling the criteria of Integrated Learning.</u> Which includes several subjects such as social studies, science, mathematics, IT,  religion, crafts, and civic education. In the beginning of the planning phase, we started with brainstorming on what names we would want to name our group, especially during the creation of our social platform. <u>The name Monkien Street was founded after much consideration to represent us because the word "Monkien" is a combination of our members' initials.</u><br><br>
    
    We then had to conduct research regarding the wants and needs of students in Santa Ursula Jakarta Middle School as they were our targeted audience and we had to estimate how much our profit will be concerning the amount of products we planned to buy both for Pre-Order and face to face sales. <u>The products were bought and priced more or less a month before the bazaar.</u> Afterwards, we proceeded to move onto the product designs and packaging because we made a few custom products such as stickers, keychains, and scrunchies. <br><br>
    
    The process of finishing the details took some time due to a series of difficulties. For instance, we cut out the outline of the sticker so that buyers can choose the specific character they want. <u>However we were briefly prepared so we could not cut all the stickers.</u> Moreover, they could open the stickers easily. <u>Additionally, products were in short supply at the end of the bazaar, and some people who had pre-ordered were not fully provided with our products.</u> Due to the lack of products, our group needed to restock a couple of things and it was quite time consuming.
